# Hi, I'm Tosin!

I am passionate about Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the ethical use of technology. My focus lies in exploring trends, uncovering insights, and developing intelligent systems that drive real-world impact. I am equally dedicated to ensuring the responsible, transparent, and compliant use of data, particularly within the realms of AI governance and privacy regulations. Currently, I am honing my skills in Python, SQL, NLP, and tools like Tableau to strengthen my ability to build data-driven solutions while deepening my understanding of AI ethics and data governance frameworks. One thing about me is that I‚Äôm always excited to learn and grow, embracing new challenges and technologies.

Feel free to scroll down and explore my projects to see how I apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

## Personal Projects
*These are personal projects I am currently working on or planning to undertake to enhance my skills and apply my learning in practical scenarios:*

## Security Incident Prediction Using SQL and Python on the Microsoft GUIDE Dataset (In-Progress)
Currently building a predictive model for cybersecurity incident triage using the Microsoft GUIDE dataset. Utilizing SQL for data processing and Python with machine learning techniques to forecast incidents and improve response workflows. This ongoing project enhances my skills in data analysis and machine learning within cybersecurity.

## [AI Governance Suite](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tosin-e/Data-Gov-Tool): Privacy, Compliance, and Data Integrity 
This project leverages AI to automate data governance tasks, including data quality checks, security, and compliance. Using machine learning, it analyzes datasets to identify anomalies, enforce policies, and ensure data integrity, minimizing manual effort.

## AI Summarizer ([Elsa](https://tosin-e-elsa-summarizer.hf.space))
Elsa is an AI-powered text summarizer that condenses lengthy documents into concise summaries using advanced NLP techniques with Transformers and PyTorch. This project showcases my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models for efficient text summarization. It's accessible via a web interface powered by Gradio and Hugging Face.
