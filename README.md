# Hi, I'm Tosin!

I am passionate about **Data Analysis** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, with a focus on exploring trends, insights, and building intelligent systems. Currently, I am enhancing my skills in **Python**, **Tableau**, **SQL**, and **NLP** to further my capabilities in both data-driven analysis and AI development.

### Personal Projects
*These are personal projects I am currently working on or planning to undertake to enhance my skills and apply my learning in practical scenarios:*

## [Elsa](https://tosin-e-elsa-summarizer.hf.space)  
Elsa is an AI-powered text summarizer that condenses lengthy documents into concise summaries. It features a responsive front-end built with HTML and CSS, a Python back-end utilizing advanced natural language processing with Transformers and PyTorch, and is deployed via a seamless web interface.
