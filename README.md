## Sales & Business Growth Analysis 

### Project Description:
This project focuses on transforming raw sales and customer data into actionable insights for business growth. Through a combination of data extraction, cleaning, and visualization, I analyzed key metrics such as product sales, customer feedback, and sales trends over time. This project also highlights practical business insights, helping companies optimize their product strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Data Extraction & Cleaning**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel Power Query
- **Data Analysis**: SQL (MySQL)
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau

## Transfer Fees vs. Player Performance: A Data-Driven Analysis

### Project Description:
This project investigates the relationship between football transfer fees and player performance metrics. By analyzing historical transfer fee data and corresponding player performance, I aim to uncover patterns and insights that could inform future transfer decisions for football clubs. The project analyzed how player performance (goals, assists, etc.) correlates with transfer fees, helping clubs make data-backed investment decisions. It identifies top-performing players relative to their transfer fees and highlights underperforming players based on high transfer costs.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Data Extraction & Cleaning**: Python (Pandas, Web Scraping)
- **Data Analysis**: Python (NumPy)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Project Files:
- **Original Dataset**: [footballproject.xlsx](https://github.com/tosin-e/tosin-e/blob/main/footballproject.xlsx)
- **Cleaned Dataset**: [cleaned_footballproject.xlsx](https://github.com/tosin-e/tosin-e/blob/main/cleaned_footballproject.xlsx)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: [football_project_analysis.ipynb](football_project_analysis.ipynb)
- **Comprehensive Report**: [transfer fees vs. player performance](https://github.com/tosin-e/tosin-e/blob/main/Transfer%20Fees%20vs.%20Player%20Performance.md)
