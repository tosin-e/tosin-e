# Hi, I'm Tosin!

I am passionate about Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on exploring trends, insights, and building intelligent systems. I am equally committed to ensuring the ethical, responsible, and transparent use of technology through AI and data governance. Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Python, SQL, NLP, and tools like Tableau to further my capabilities in both data-driven analysis and AI development, while also deepening my understanding of privacy regulations, AI ethics, and governance frameworks.

## Personal Projects
*These are personal projects I am currently working on or planning to undertake to enhance my skills and apply my learning in practical scenarios:*

## AI Governance Suite: Privacy, Compliance, and Data Integrity (Ongoing)
This project leverages AI to automate data governance tasks, including data quality checks, security, and compliance. Using machine learning, it analyzes datasets to identify anomalies, enforce policies, and ensure data integrity, minimizing manual effort.

## AI Summarizer ([Elsa](https://tosin-e-elsa-summarizer.hf.space))
Elsa is an AI-powered text summarizer that condenses lengthy documents into concise summaries using advanced NLP techniques with Transformers and PyTorch. This project showcases my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models for efficient text summarization. It's accessible via a web interface powered by Gradio and Hugging Face.
